## Potentially sensitive data stored in local value.

### Explanation


Sensitive attributes such as passwords and API tokens should not be available in your templates, especially in a plaintext form. You can declare variables to hold the secrets, assuming you can provide values for those variables in a secure fashion. Alternatively, you can store these secrets in a secure secret store, such as AWS KMS.

*NOTE: It is also recommended to store your Terraform state in an encrypted form.*



### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the GEN002 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

locals {
  password = "p4ssw0rd"
}

resource "evil_corp" "virtual_machine" {
	root_password = local.password
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the GEN002 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

variable "password" {
  description = "The root password for our VM"
  type        = string
}

resource "evil_corp" "virtual_machine" {
	root_password = var.password
}

{% endhighlight %}
