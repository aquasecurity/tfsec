		Summary:    "Redshift cluster should be deployed into a specific VPC",
		Impact:     "Redshift cluster does not benefit from VPC security if it is deployed in EC2 classic mode",
		Resolution: "Deploy Redshift cluster into a non default VPC",
		Explanation: `Redshift clusters that are created without subnet details will be created in EC2 classic mode, meaning that they will be outside of a known VPC and running in tennant.

In order to benefit from the additional security features achieved with using an owned VPC, the subnet should be set.`,
